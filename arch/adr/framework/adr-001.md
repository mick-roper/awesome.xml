# Framwork Choice

# Context

We need a framework that:

* works with as many dotnet versions as possible
* is as fututre proof as possible
* allows best practice
* can be turned into a nuget package easily

# Decision

We'll use .Net Standard 1.6

## Reasons

* It can be used with .Net Framework 4.6 +
* It can be used with .Net Core 1.6 +

Anything older than these 2 versions is something we arent going to test with, and so cannot offer support for.
